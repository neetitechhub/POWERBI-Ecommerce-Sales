**This project focused on practicing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights from a sales dataset. The following tasks were accomplished as part of the analysis:**

**Total Rows in Table: **Counted the total number of records in the sales table.
**Total Sales:** Calculated the overall sales revenue.
**Average Sales: **Computed the average sales per transaction.
**Total Profit:** Derived total profit across all sales transactions.
**Country-Specific Sales:** Filtered and analyzed sales for the country "France."
**Product-Specific Profit:** Analyzed the profit for the product category "Carretera."
**Sales in 2014: **Calculated the total sales for the year 2014.
**Units Sold in the Last 60 Days:** Tracked the number of units sold within the last 60 days.
**Sales on Specific Date (01/01/2014):** Analyzed sales performance on a given date.
**Worst Performing Products:** Identified the 3 lowest-performing products by sales.
**Best Performing Products:** Highlighted the 3 best-selling products.
**Profit/Loss Analysis:** Assessed the profit or loss for each product.
**Country-Wise Sales:** Aggregated sales data based on country.
**Profit/Loss Percentage: **Calculated the profit or loss percentage for each product.
**Yearly/Monthly Sales Analysis:** Generated sales reports on a yearly and monthly basis.
**Selected Countries Display:** Displayed selected countries as comma-separated values.

This exercise improved my skills in using DAX for advanced calculations and data analysis within Power BI, improving the ability to derive actionable insights from sales data.
